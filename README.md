# LX-PREF
This are my bash and vim settings, feel free to use them if you wish
Here is a oneliner that installs the settings to your system
``` bash
curl -k -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HX-Rd/lx-pref/master/install.sh >> install.sh ; chmod +x install.sh ; $HOME/install.sh ; source $HOME/.bashrc
```
